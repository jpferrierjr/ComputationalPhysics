# ComputationalPhysics
This repository is meant to teach ALL aspects of computational physics through the use of exploiting mathematical models. I will continue to add to this repository as I find more time to teach this. Please reference this repository to become an absolute expert at computational physics!

## Ok, but why should I trust you? Who are you?
My name is John Ferrier. I'm a PhD physicist who specializes in Condensed Matter Physics. My background centers around the intersection of cutting-edge machine learning techniques, experimental condensed matter physics for 2D quantum materials, Density Functional Theory (DFT) based computations of thermodynamic properties of materials. In my PhD work, these topics were all leveraged to predict the experimental conditions under which 2D quantum crystals will form.

I've been developing software since 2010 (14+ yrs) and utilizing computational physics with C++ and Python since 2012 (12+ yrs). Over the years I've developed acoustical physics models, microfluidic system models, Chemical Vapor Deposition fluid flow simulations, electron molecular density SCF models, and custom molecular dynamics softwares. While I've done much more than what is listed here, these are the most relevant to what my goals are with this repository.

## Getting Started
I will be sharing each section as a Python Notebook. Because of this, I highly suggest using something like the Jupyter extension on VS Code to view these files and run them locally. I intend to include all necessary python requirements in each file and explain the transition from physics theory to computational techniques as clearly as I can.
